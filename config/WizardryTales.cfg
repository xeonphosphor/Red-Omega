            Might I interest you in any spells, perhaps?
            Magic is everywhere, if you know where to look.
            There is still much to be learned about the arcane arts, adventurer.
            Perhaps you have learned something yourself that you wish to share?
            Studying the arcane is most fascinating, don't you think?
            The duty of a Wizard is to protect their house, and their hearth.
            I would like to talk about spells.
            The cataclysm destroyed most of big buildings that were here.
            I remember how it feels when you lose your loved ones.
            I can't imagine how long it will take to create a new spell.
            Greetings, traveller. What brings you here?
            Elemental creatures are truly dangerous!
            I've seen big white spider recently, their name is White Spiders, and they manipulate the space and time around them
            Spellcasting witches are one of my worst nightmares...
            A lot of us become simply mad, and becoming angry, because of how magic affects our old bodies... some of us even just stalk others in different places.
            The cataclysm changed everything..
            Someone might find a way to become eternal...
            Most people do not know how it feels to lose your memories...
            Is it just me, or did I just hear some strange sounds over there?
            Dear traveller, you should buy something, or I will go to sleep.
            My memories fade...
            The weather isn't good these days.

            Spells are such a great thing to use!
            As teacher says: We always know what we want, but we don't.. But what actually that means...
            Ugh... another failed spell creation!
            It's so terrible that elemental monsters are appearing, so now I'm thinking of buying a Scroll of Holy Barrier for my house!
            I have nothing to say to you.
            Sometimes I totally lose my memory.. what was I doing... I'm like in a time loop, but different! I can't understand this really...
            Midnight traders are the best!
            Do you have a Familiar?
            I've used my last Teleportation Scroll this week! Oh no!
            If you can teach me magic I'll be glad!
